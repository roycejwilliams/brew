# Brew

Brew is a social app for creating small, intentional moments and letting the right people join — whether they’re already in your circle or around you.

Instead of broadcasting events, Brew focuses on presence, trust, and resonance.

---

## What Brew Is

Brew lets you:

Create lightweight, real-world moments

Choose who can see them:

Your Circle (trusted groups)

Specific People

Around You (nearby discovery)

Stay in control of who joins

Keep social interactions calm, human, and intentional

Brew is not an event platform.
It’s a way to say “I’m here — if this resonates, join.”

---

## Core Concepts

### Moments

Moments are small, time-bound social experiences.
They’re defined by:

vibe
time
place
openness

---

### Circles

Circles are pre-trusted groups you control.
They’re the default for intimate moments.

---

### Around You

“Around You” makes a moment discoverable, not broadcast.

Nearby people may see it
They can request to join
The host always decides

No public feeds. No follower counts. No noise.

---

### Pulse & Signals

Pulse is the live map of what’s happening now

Signals are meaningful updates — not notifications

---

## Design Philosophy

Human > Viral

Discovery > Broadcasting

Consent > Configuration

Calm > Urgency

Brew avoids:

follower mechanics
algorithmic feeds
engagement traps
loud UI patterns

---

## AI (Intentional, Minimal)

AI in Brew is used to sharpen human intent, not replace it.

Planned uses include:

Moment refinement (clarity & tone)

Invite ranking (resonance, not exclusion)

Discovery matching for “Around You”

Post-moment reflection

AI never:

decides for the user
explains itself
blocks people outright

---

## MVP Status

Current MVP focuses on validating one loop:

A user creates a moment → someone joins → something real happens.

Advanced intelligence, analytics, and optimization come later.

---

## Tech Stack (subject to change)

React / Next.js

Motion for UI transitions

Mapbox-based mapping

Server-side APIs for moments & signals

(Details intentionally light — Brew is product-first.)

---

## Project Status

Private beta in progress :)

Brew is actively evolving.
The focus right now is real-world behavior, not feature breadth.
